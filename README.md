## üöÄ About Me

I thrive on bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and practical, real-world systems. Whether it's simulating EMR workflows to make healthcare AI more reliable or experimenting with generative models for creative problem-solving, I enjoy pushing projects from idea to production with a focus on scalability and impact. My work blends a strong foundation in computer science with hands-on engineering, letting me adapt quickly across domains like blockchain, cloud-native systems, and machine learning.

Currently pursuing my **Master's in Computer Science at USC** (Expected May 2026), I'm passionate about exploring how technology shapes the world around us. I enjoy tackling complex problems in data ethics, healthcare innovation, and human-AI collaboration through both academic research and practical side projects.
